# 🧠 The Impact of Blockchain in Quantum Computing

This repository contains a research project exploring the intersection of **quantum computing** and **blockchain technology**, authored by Reem Bekdash and Orzu Mirzovalizoda.

## 📄 Project Overview

Quantum computing poses both a **threat** and an **opportunity** to blockchain systems. While quantum algorithms like **Shor's** can break traditional cryptography (e.g., RSA, ECC), they also provide solutions through enhanced performance, security, and scalability.

In this project, we:
- Simulated a **hybrid quantum-classical blockchain** system using IBM’s **Qiskit**.
- Applied **Grover’s Algorithm** to accelerate transaction validation.
- Implemented **Quantum Key Distribution (QKD)** to enhance security.
- Demonstrated a **50% reduction** in transaction verification time (from 10s to 5s).
- Achieved **92% accuracy** compared to classical methods.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Accelerate transaction verification using quantum search.
- Reduce energy consumption.
- Develop quantum-resilient smart contracts.
- Integrate post-quantum cryptography and QKD.

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python** – Core implementation
- **IBM Qiskit** – Quantum circuit simulation
- **NumPy** – Data processing
- **Cryptography Library** – RSA-PSS (for simulation)
- **Quantum Algorithms** – Grover’s & QAOA

## 📉 Limitations

- Simulated environment only (no real quantum hardware).
- RSA used (not quantum-safe).
- Smart contracts not yet implemented.
- Small-scale testing (1000 transactions, 10 blocks).

## 🚀 Future Work

- Use quantum-safe algorithms (e.g., **Dilithium**, **Falcon**).
- Implement quantum-secure smart contracts.
- Scale to multi-node distributed systems.
- Explore noise resilience and real-time dashboards.
